Instructions:

In this assignment, you will write a Java program that implements a solution to the bounded buffer problem between a producer and a consumer. Requirements are:

The producer will produce forever and the consumer will consume forever.

The producer will put data into a shared buffer and the consumer will remove data from the shared buffer. The shared buffer should have a declared size of 5.

The buffer must implement a means of ensuring that the buffer never enters an underflow state (i.e., takes too much data out) or an overflow state (i.e., puts too much data into the buffer).

The shared buffer must include functionality so that a critical region problem does not occur with parallel updates to the data.

Test your application by creating a java thread for the producer and a java thread for the consumer. The producer and consumer share a common buffer.
